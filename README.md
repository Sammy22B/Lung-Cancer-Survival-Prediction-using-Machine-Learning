# Lung-Cancer-Survival-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A predictive ML project that estimates lung cancer patient survival outcomes based on diagnostic, clinical, and lifestyle factors using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
# ü´Å Lung Cancer Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts **lung cancer patient survival outcomes** based on diagnostic, clinical, and lifestyle data. It uses multiple supervised learning algorithms to classify whether a patient **survived or not** after lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.

---

## üéØ Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts the **survival status** of lung cancer patients based on demographic, clinical, and lifestyle-related features.  
The aim is to assist healthcare professionals in understanding critical survival factors and improving patient prognosis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`id`, `country`)  
- Converted date columns (`diagnosis_date`, `end_treatment_date`) to datetime format  
- Computed **treatment duration** as new feature (`treatment_duration_days`)  
- Encoded categorical variables into numeric form  
- Applied **StandardScaler** to scale numerical features  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized class distribution of survival outcomes  
- Plotted histograms for key numeric features (`age`, `bmi`, `cholesterol_level`, `treatment_duration_days`)  
- Displayed **correlation heatmap** of clinical and demographic features  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning
Used three supervised ML algorithms:

| Model | Description | Tuning Method |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | Baseline linear classifier | GridSearchCV (C parameter) |
| Random Forest Classifier | Ensemble learning method | GridSearchCV (n_estimators, max_depth) |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | RBF kernel-based classifier | GridSearchCV (C, gamma) |

Each model was trained, tested, and evaluated on 80/20 split data.
